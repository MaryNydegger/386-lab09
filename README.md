# Lab 9

### Setup and Submission - please read and follow carefully
* *Accept the Assignment*: When you accept the assignment in GitHub Classroom, a repository named `lab-09` will be automatically generated for you under the "s386Fall2023" organization.
* *Locate Your Repository*: Your personal repository for this homework can be found at `https://github.com/s386Fall2023/lab-09-your_user_name`.
* *Clone the Repository*: 
    - Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to download the repository.
    - Run `git clone your_repository_URL` to clone the repository onto your local machine.
* *Create a `.gitignore file*:
    - Before committing your work, create a `.gitignore` file appropriate for this assignment.  
* *Working Directory*: The cloning process will create a new directory named `lab-09-your_user_name`. Ensure that you perform all your work inside this directory.
* *Commit Your Progress*: As you work on the assignment, remember to commit your changes periodically. You can easily do this using Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
* *Remote Connection*: If you've cloned the repository correctly and are working within the created directory, the remote link to your GitHub repository should already be configured.
* *Virtual Environment*: Ensure that you are using the class's virtual environment while working on this assignment.
   - Note:  There is no way to tell from your submission whether or not you use the class environment.  However, if you are working in the virtual environment set up for our class, then you can be sure that you are using the correct versions of the packages.
* *File and Function Names*:
    - Your repository should contain the following files:
        * This `Readme.md` file
        * The included .gitignore file
        * The `lab-09-questions.ipynb` file containing the neat and well-documented code you used to complete the assignment
* *Submission to Gradescope*:    
    - Once you've completed the assignment, go to Gradescope and select your personal homework repository (`https://github.com/s386Fall2023/lab-09-your_user_name`) as the source for your submission.
